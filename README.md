# Convert Numpy/Scipy arrays to formatted LaTeX arrays

`array_to_latex` converts a Numpy/Scipy array to a LaTeX array including
python (c) style formating of the result.

The default is to print the result, but perhaps having it return a
string represention would be useful for someone else in the future.

What I need to do to get this to install properly with pip

Still needs unit tests.
